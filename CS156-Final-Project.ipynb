    "Using data from a publicly-available dataset, build a model with a machine learning technique to a achieve a practical / humorous goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple large datasets available on the web, for example:\n",
    "- Awesome Public Datasets\n",
    "- Google Public Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique(s) that you use needn't have been covered in CS156. Give a detailed explanation of the algorithm(s) that you chose to implement your application, and provide a clear and compelling argument as to why your approach was superior to any alternatives. Provide data giving insight into the empirical performance of your solution (making sure that you have picked a metric which measures the correct aspect of its performance).\n",

    "Creative and novel applications are encouraged!\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. Write a short email proposal describing the project you wish to work on.\n",
    "Include the problem definition, as well as a brief description of the proposed solution using machine learning.\n",
    "Email your proposal to your professor to get feedback before you start work.\n",
    "You are encouraged to do this early on to ensure that your proposed scope of work is appropriate and achievable by the end of the semester.\n",
    "Implement your machine learning approach and test it appropriately.\n",
    "Write a short 3-4 page report with the following headings: 1. Problem Definition, 2. Solution Specification, 3. Testing and Analysis, 4. References, 5. Appendices.\n",
    "There is no length limit on the references or appendices, where you should include any source code or datasets if appropriate.\n",
    "Submit your report in PDF format, in addition to a zip file containing your code.\n",
    "Poorly formatted or overly long reports will be marked down on the #professionalism HC."
